25 Servings

INGREDIENTS:

125g butter, softened
3/4 cup (115g) plain flour
1/4 cup (45g) icing sugar mixture
1/3 cup (50g) custard powder
60g butter, softened, extra
2/3 cup (110g) icing sugar mixture, extra
2 tsp finely grated lemon rind
1 tbs lemon juice

METHOD:

Step 1
Preheat oven to 160°C. Line 2 oven trays with baking paper. Use an electric mixer
to beat butter until pale and creamy. Add the flour, icing sugar and custard
powder and use a wooden spoon to stir to combine.

Step 2
Use your hands to roll teaspoonsful of the dough mixture into balls. Place the 
balls 3cm apart on the lined trays. Use a fork dusted in icing sugar to gently 
flatten. Bake in preheated oven, swapping trays halfway through cooking, for 
15 minutes or until just cooked through. Remove from oven and set aside for 
30 minutes to cool.

Step 3
Use an electric mixer to beat the extra butter and icing sugar in a bowl until 
light and fluffy. Add the lemon rind and juice and beat until combined. Spread 
the butter mixture over the flat side of half the biscuits and sandwich together 
with remaining biscuits.
