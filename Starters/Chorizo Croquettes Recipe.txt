Chorizo Croquettes Recipe - Damien Lehkyj
16 Servings

INGREDIENTS:
1 (about 120g) chorizo, finely chopped
100g butter
100g (2/3 cup) plain flour
375ml (1 1/2 cups) milk
2 tbs chopped fresh continental parsley
40g (1/4 cup) plain flour, extra
2 eggs, lightly whisked
160g (2 1/4 cups) fresh breadcrumbs
Light olive oil, to deep-fry


METHOD:
Step 1
Cook the chorizo in a non-stick frying pan over high heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes or until crisp.
Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel.

Step 2
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Stir in the flour for 1 minute.
Remove from heat. Stir in one-third of the milk. Gradually stir in remaining milk until the mixture thickens.
Stir over medium-high heat for a further 2 minutes or until very thick.

Step 3
Stir in the chorizo and parsley. Season with pepper. Transfer to a shallow container. Set aside to cool slightly.
Cover and place in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight to set.

Step 4
Place the extra flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Use floured hands to roll tablespoonfuls of chorizo
mixture into 8cm-long croquettes. Roll each croquette in flour and shake off excess. Dip in egg, then in breadcrumbs
to coat. Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.

Step 5
Add oil to a large saucepan to come 5cm up the side of the pan. Heat to 170C over medium-high heat (when oil is ready
a cube of bread will turn golden brown in 20 seconds). Cook croquettes, in 3 batches, turning occasionally, for 1-2 minutes
or until golden and heated through. Transfer to a tray lined with paper towel.
